## MkDocs

  * http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/

MkDocs is a very simple python based site generator that reads in markdown files and auto generates a site
which can be auto published to a Git Repo's gh-pages branch.
Anything posted within a gh-pages branch on github is automatically visible as a static web site.

## Script commands

  * **build.py build** - Do a dummy build into the site sub-directory
  * **build.py build_doxygen** - Do the build of the doxygen files
  * **build.py publish** - Generate and publish a site to github.io (gh-pages branch) for the repo
  * **build.py serve** - Auto Serv the site on http://127.0.0.1:8000

One of the advantages to the serve command is that any changes to the mark down files while viewing the site
cause the browser to auto refresh the site as it's being viewed, for live editing.
However I find it's best to use this without the doxygen content when there is a large amount of API's to parse.

## Doxygen Notes

There are a couple of option that will enable more graphs. <br>
However this will result in a large file count / processing time to generate the Doxygen content.

  * HAVE_DOT
  * CLASS_DIAGRAMS

## Install

  * First install python 3
  * Install Doxygen
  * Install graphviz (add to path, typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38\bin)
  * Then install a bunch of different python modules using pip

```
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-bootswatch mkdocs-bootstrap mkdocs-alabaster BeautifulSoup4
```

## Theme

The theme directory contains overrides for the bootswatch themes

  * Doxygen link added onto the far right
    (this avoids problems when using serve and linking to doxygen under the pages section)
  * Added edit button in Nav to take advantage of edit_uri / edit_url
  * Width has been altered for the navbar / wider viewing

## General Process

In order to intergrate with Doxygen the process is a little hacky

  * First a General build of the MkDocs site is done into the site sub-directory
  * Next the Doxygen footer / header templates are re-generated by extracting code from index.html within the generated MkDocs site
  * Next the Doxygen content is generated and copied across into the Docs/doxygen directory
  * Next Mkdocs is run to generate the site including the Doxygen content

On first run or if the source code changes run this to generate the doxygen files
```
build.py build_doxygen
```

On subsequent runs to develop / alter the docs use the below, then alter the markdown files while viewing in browser
```
build.py serve
```

Finally to publish the site to a gh-pages branch use
```
build.py publish
```
